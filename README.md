This is my GitHub pages repository; currently it simply redirects back to my [main GitHub profile](https://github.com/gamatos) and is only set up so that I can configure a custom domain for pages associated to specific projects (see e.g. [matos.dev/Basinhopping.jl](matos.dev/Basinhopping.jl)). You can find my personal website [here](gabrielmatos.com).
